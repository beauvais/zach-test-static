										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More than 20 years ago, Glasgow had more than its fair share of comfortable coffee shops. Several were lodged in bookshops, and one in particular pulls it’s way across time, sliding it’s memory-laden charge along neurones and drops me into an overstuffed chair in a little alcove. I’ve got a small table next to me, on which I’ve stacked books from the shop downstairs. I have no memory of which books these are.</p>



<p>My drink was probably quite bad by my since-radicalised standards of coffee: scalded milk and burnt espresso. And, as was the fashion in those days, served fluffy like a failing soufflé in a mug large enough to also serve as a good-sized house planter.</p>



<p>I had a book open on my knee, and enjoyed just how incredible it felt. Not the book, but the moment. My life as a 17-year-old, trailer-park escapee somehow found space In it to show me one of my happiest moments.</p>



<p>Nothing happened. I read some pages of a book I can’t remember (if I could hazard a guess, it might have been Bill Bryson’s Mother Tongue). I put down the book as such archaic mugs were two-handed vessels. I put sugar in it from little, straw-like sachets to take the edge off the bitterness. And I looked out the rain-beaded window down onto Glasgow. My favourite place on earth at the time. My first non-American residence.</p>



<p>This memory of a few moments plays in my mind like an IPhone photo you accidentally touch: it plays for a few seconds, a d occasionally loops.</p>



<p>I don’t know the spot, I couldn’t tell you the bookstore or name the cafe.</p>



<p>I was 17 in Glasgow, drinking coffee and reading books at night in a leather chair overlooking rain-puddles through rain and a rain-soaked window.</p>



<p>If I could choose a moment that captures my soul in time, stored in a crystal, this would be a high contender. I knew who I was, where I wanted to be, and would happily live eternity sat in that chair in aspic.</p>

<p>Facebook shows me.</p>



<p>Photos of old friends I’ve not seen in a decade, or more. It tells me people who don’t know me from Adam think I should go fund them. It applies a bolt of you know, those hormones that make you start, sweat, and feel like you’re not really here? Like you’re not sure who the hell you are?</p>



<p>It reminds me of long walks with my good dog that finish up at the fire with pint glasses and friends. Bliss I can recall with a blink and a think anytime I like — but I don’t too often as it makes me cry.</p>



<p>It reminds me of walking past 15th century homes on my way to pick up milk and bread, looking around like: “I’m in heaven now.”</p>



<p>It reminds me of my intense colleagues where I felt a rush for the work I was doing, for the permission just to be part of something exciting.</p>



<p>It shows me steak and frite, Belgian beer bought in Bruges brewed by brothers in brown. Waffles on cobbled streets and Flemish masters’ coloured oil.</p>



<p>It reminds me of times I couldn’t walk.</p>



<p>It shows me pictures of my hand, more machine now than man, twisted and evil… or, hopped up on tramadol watching csf leak from my ear.</p>



<p>It shows me pills and slings.</p>



<p>It shows moving boxes.</p>



<p>It shows me moving boxes.</p>



<p>It shows me unpacking moving boxes.</p>



<p>It shows me a new dog.</p>



<p>It shows me my dead dog.</p>



<p>It shows a different car, full of moving boxes, and a different car in a different driveway.</p>



<p>It shows me the letters I wrote to stop the vote. It shows me my pleas not to rip Europe away from me.</p>



<p>It shows me stood with the Queen’s face acrylic as a man with a sword stood while I submitted myself to her painted majesty.</p>



<p>It shows me the place where a bishop flicked cold water on my face and made me a different kind of Christian — whatever that means.</p>



<p>It shows me in a car with the wheel on the left. On the right. It reminds me I’m in Indiana, Ithaca, New York America, Cambridge, Yorkshire, Northants, Shrops, Herts, N1.</p>



<p>It plays with my timeline, it’s algorithm learning to crack the psyche of those weak-minded people like me (<em>waves</em>) whose grasp on their own identity is always tenuous.</p>



<p>Who the hell am I, anyway.</p>



<p>I want my dog and hillwalking. I’ve not got any.</p>



<p>I’d like a pint, but haven’t got that either.</p>



<p>I’d like mates.</p>



<p>I’d like me. Whichever’s available, whichever’s familiar. I’ll wait here while the algorithm tells<br />Me<br />A story<br />About our hero<br />Who’s called Zach — and that’s all we can tell<br />You right now.</p>



<p>“We value your memories.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A few days ago, I wrote this piece on Facebook in response to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pelosi-staff-barricaded-themselves-in-room-as-rioters-looted-office-2021-1">a Business Insider article about the riots at Capitol Hill</a> on 6th January, 2021.</p>



<p>In it, they said that Nancy Pelosi (the Speaker of the House) said that <em>&#8220;rioters thumped on the door of the barricaded conference room while staffers hid, and that <strong>in taking cover they had followed active shooter drills learnt in high school</strong>.&#8221;</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>I was 15 when they started drills. They weren’t called “active shooters,” they were called “school shootings.”</p>



<p>Our teacher, Mr Smith, held up a sign that seemed to have been printed and laminated that morning.</p>



<p>“This red sign means that we’ve got wounded people in this room. If you have to put it up, it’s because I’m dead, because no one is getting to you without going through me.” We believed him. Mr Smith was an agreed badass.</p>



<p>It was in the few days that followed Columbine.</p>



<p>Newsreaders continuously repeated that Colorado and national authorities fear “copycat crimes.” We kept seeing our state emblem, the sweet little Rocky Mountain columbine, on national news. The very word chills me now, more than two decades later. It was the name of a high school so very much like ours, just up I-25, a couple hours away.</p>



<p>My friends and I speculated about how we could get down from the huge windows that overlooked empty, dust-yellow fields. We reckoned that between us, we could probably smash them, but some were dubious. They were massive, double-glazed, Colorado-weather-resistant panes in steel frames. Someone pointed out that there was a weight room next door, and we could use the barbell arms to jam the door, and the dumbbells to bash even these windows.</p>



<p>But, how would we get down?</p>



<p>“I could jump that! Shit, if someone’s shooting, we’ll all jump that. Better to break a leg and run than get fucking shot.”</p>



<p>Several weeks later, the entire school marched out and walked hundreds of students down the road to the nearest middle school, where we sat on the gym floor for several hours while Mr Smith kept reassuring us that it was going to be ok.</p>



<p>“They’ll clear the school, and sweep every room. They’ll make absolutely sure it’s safe, and there aren’t any bombs.”</p>



<p>Everyone was remarkably calm, spoke in whispers, and stared blankly a lot. Repeated phrases of “copycat,” and “bomb threat.”</p>



<p>I never learned the full story. Rumours were that a student had called in a bomb threat. I’ve never been clear, and the memories are vague. We all marched back, and parents came and calmly picked up their kids.</p>



<p>But, I can still hear the sound of our knuckles knocking on those windows, testing their solidity. I still imagine trying to smash them with the dumbbells from next door.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignwide is-style-solid-color"><blockquote><p>Every American young enough to have been in school in the early 2000s has been taught how to react to gunmen just for going to school.</p><p>That is the strongest story I know about what is wrong with America.</p></blockquote></figure>

<h1>Just_type.</h1>



<p><em>No editing. Full-on whatever the hell comes out of the fingers goes on the screen. (I&#8217;ve not done this in a while). Sorry. Sorry for all of it.</em></p>



<p>I&#8217;m trying to understand why I cannot easily focus right now. Trying to think about my mental health and deep feelings of insecurity and anxiety amongst any contexts that affect it. Not all that great in the head.</p>



<p>Who is, anyway?</p>



<p>But contexts don&#8217;t map cleanly like a flow chart in a business-logic decision tree. They&#8217;re layers needing peeling back to understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>



<p>The layers peel back, the sticky, weighted layers of something with a physicality to it, even though it&#8217;s just an idea. If the layers were a thing, they&#8217;d be resistant to peeling cleanly, like an over-warmed, then forgotten for a decade book of stamps, a price sticker on a delicate item like a RAM chip. The packaging of a box of gummy worms, where the packaging is a gummy worm. Sticky, unappealing and not-a-peeling.</p>



<p>These layers, right? They&#8217;re also not easy to shift. They&#8217;re weighted, but not evenly. They&#8217;re a net made of lead inside a duvet filled with jelly and resin – resin that bleeds through the duvet and bonds with the layers below and above. Heavy in all the wrong places, lifted like a just-fucking too-big bag of sharp sand mixed with hard rubber balls, odd-sized wire, and pillow stuffing and string.</p>



<p>Shedloads of unwound string spools.</p>



<p>Like peeling an onion with your newly over-trimmed fingernails; an onion made of slugs who&#8217;ve just crawled through CA glue.</p>



<p>We get to the heart of the matter, a heart shrouded in paywalls, passwords, applications, background checks, armour, and defensive capabilities. This heart of the matter, sodden with the above layers&#8217; various detritus, residues, and impressions. String, jelly, bits of lead: all souvenirs of how you got to the heart of the matter.</p>



<p>The layers are plentiful, potent, potentially problematic. They are Pandemic. Politics. Prospects. Position. Productivity. Purpose. Parenthood.</p>



<p>At the heart, under these noxious worlds of pestilence, social unrest, drastic-rapid cultural change, the fall of church, the fall of religion, the fall of empires, the falling away of old lies that are no longer alive, but their corpses trip so many people that understanding and truth are falling away like the scales from the blind eyes, leaving us aching for meaning, reason, faith, love and vision – but what&#8217;s left to see when we&#8217;ve been purged of the good along with the bad?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last week, I posted a Facebook announcement to a group of woodworkers that I administer. The post reiterated our inclusive stance and made it explicit that we do not allow racist content, and won’t take down anti-racist work. For example, we refused to remove a spoon that had written on it “craft against racism.”</p>



<p>We made it clear that we are anti-racist, that Black lives matter.</p>



<p>The response was decidedly mixed, and I received threats and irate comments and angry direct messages.</p>



<p>Disregarding the pure threat and a few overt racist posts, most of the anger shared a common theme: “I’m tired of hearing about racism! Leave me alone and let me have this space without your politics!”</p>



<p>Many people pointed out that this is a position of privilege. Choosing whether to engage in this is a luxury not given to people who experience racism.</p>



<p>And, here I suggest this exhaustion with engagement is deliberate. Not that racists have tired themselves out, but that people who haven’t yet addressed the problem of racism are already tired, and their safe space feels threatened.</p>



<p>I also suggest that if this started in a time of peace, that I wouldn’t have received nearly as many angry posts. That many of these people would have actually given the idea pause and maybe thought it through enough to support an overt anti-racist platform. They’d be more open to active inclusion, and making their safe space more open to others.</p>



<p>But, I think that people across the works have been deliberately worn down until they don’t have spare capacity for thought – that they respond quicker and more emotionally than they might do if rested. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an excuse. Non-engagement is not an ethical option. Standing against racism is the only course of not-racist action. In other words, if you have a choice, doing nothing supports racism.</p>



<p>I’m rereading a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0796DNSVZ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Fascism Works</a>. It’s got a lot of details and deep thinking, but it’s also good at showing some straightforward tactics common to fascist and other authoritarian regimes. All centre on division.</p>



<p>Creating or emphasising existing fear and framing stories (rewriting history or simply lying) enough to where people stop trusting, act from fear and insecurity, and mindlessly back whomever offers security, familiarity; or just not engaging, making space for people who want power.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m too tired for your anti-racism,&#8221; is a terrible excuse for demeaning, shouting down, or directly insulting people. But, it’s not impossible to feel a tiny bit of sympathy for the idea that people are too tired to engage. Frankly, I got bloody tired of their anger, too tired of the racist posts, too tired of engaging in the same discussions that didn’t need rehashing.</p>



<p>Peace be with you.</p>

<p>A week of sleepless nights. I thought for sure I&#8217;d be asleep straight away. But, closing ones eyes often opens up the mind and heart. Sometimes, they can be distracted by fun and games – light-hearted telly, breathing exercises.</p>



<p><br>But, draw back, look at what&#8217;s going on, and the medicinal application of comfort and numbing agents of Frasier, aircon, the Great British Bake Off is only affecting the innermost layer; wrapping the core in a soporific poultice.</p>



<p><br>But, it doesn&#8217;t cage reason. It doesn&#8217;t change rising tension, months of isolation (after years of pretty bad mental-health situations of hermitage. It doesn&#8217;t address chronic physical pain, (though that&#8217;s closest to the comfort wrap).</p>



<p><br>I realised, though, that it also burdens reason. Your thinking mind shrugs it down like a stifling blanket. It&#8217;s not do be lulled right now. It&#8217;s distracting from analysis, strategy, creativity, and grieving that needs doing. Sometimes, the problem is about balancing such things: allotting space in your life for planning and making, for inspiration and exercise.<br>So, draw back, note the things you can do better next time, etc. That&#8217;s an activity, it&#8217;s something you could do, something you can control. You&#8217;d make Epictetus proud.</p>



<p><br>But, our minds matter, and the world matters, and the layers of evil, stress, and fear also matter. The world isn&#8217;t mine to change, but a small part of it is my home. I&#8217;ll tend my mind and garden, as best I can. But sometimes, the besiegers win battles, and trying to sleep through the storm isn&#8217;t an easy undertaking. And, sometimes, it&#8217;s not your fault that you can&#8217;t sleep. Sometimes, you&#8217;re in for some misery, and there isn&#8217;t a nice pick-me up, &#8220;give yourself some me-time&#8221; fixes. That&#8217;s the hard truth – and the comfort –cold it well might be. You know your burden tomorrow, and maybe some more. You also know better what is beyond you, and you can with a clear conscience shrug off the burden of guilt or personal victim hood.</p>



<p><em>Peace be with you.</em></p>

<p>When someone asked: “Wait. Why do we all wave at the end of Zoom meetings, now?”</p>



<p>My reply:</p>



<p>Cause you can’t find the unmute button, because that window is on the other monitor, and it’s behind the Facebook window, and your mouse is busy clicking on the latest coronavirus statistics news charts, and someone says bye in your headphones and it suddenly reminds you you’re in a meeting; and that it’s ending. So, you wave frantically, putting all the energy you feel you can that makes it seem you’re super invested in&#8230; (opens up Calendar app to check agenda notes&#8230; can’t even find the agenda&#8230; this is the same meeting we had last week but someone couldn’t Zoom then, so it literally just says: “Repeat”); so you add an additional, extra-mouth-action <em><strong>“Stay Safe!!!!” </strong></em>Before clicking “Leave” and the “are you sure?” Then again. You force-quit Zoom, shut down the laptop, disconnect the router and have a quick cry.</p>



<p>No?</p>



<p>Just me?</p>

<p>A friend posted a link to an article that said something about the disease mess were in right now.</p>



<p>This friend has a different friendship network from me. It’s interesting to see what their network thinks and says, so I happened to have a look at the dozen or so comments.</p>



<p>Every single comment (at the time I looked) on their post was someone saying that the pandemic is a hoax. We need to reopen, and the libtards are keeping us locked up.</p>



<p>Another friend shared a similar post (same subtopic of the apocalypse — I’ve forgotten the exact title). Every single comment was about how we need to lock down tighter to control the pandemic. Some were scared that the people protesting are going to spread it even worse. How the stupid wingers are going to get us all killed through ignorance.</p>



<p>We are all breathing recycled air on social media. Not one person I know (I’m pretty sure) thinks this is a hoax (including the person posting that link).</p>



<p>We’re not talking to one another. We’re shouting into the cave of our people and our echoed voices come back to agree.</p>



<p>So, amped and propped up, one group points their megaphone-shaped community voice at another. And it feels like a scream. Rage, fear, challenge, insecurity, vulnerability, weakness, power and dread.</p>



<p>This doesn’t lead to shared knowledge. It doesn’t lead to ideas being polished and refined. And, it doesn’t lead to community building. It’s antisocial, inhuman, and it makes every encounter we have with other tribes combative and shouty. We fight back or flee.</p>



<p>We always hear the same shit we say and vigorously applaud ourselves. Or we fight, with emotions primed with fight-flight adrenaline, consideration and reason set aside in favour of the screams and cries. Blood pumps round our ears before thought enters our minds.</p>



<p>It keeps us divided.</p>



<p>Peace be with you.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been exhorting people to create. To reach out, and make something, in this pandemic – this soul-sucking time that suffocates spirit by cutting off humanity from our lifeline of humans. Creating extends. You reach for tools, for cameras, you stretch before and after you make.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t reach to read the news, you haunch, hunker-down. You turn in with your arms, back and shoulders – and keep turning your eyes, mind, and reason. All in.</p>



<p>You try to unpick, to break apart the things in front of you to make sense of them. This is fed by stories, stats, data, opinion and analysis. Then, you&#8217;re doing analysis: breaking things apart to find out what&#8217;s happening next.</p>



<p>But, analysis is destructive. It leaves behind broken wholes. You have to think, apply your own mind – with it&#8217;s eclectic collection of contexts. And, to get the thing you want: understanding insight, you have to build something.</p>



<p>You make sense of analysis not by analying (breaking down, quantifying, reducing to components), but through _creation._ You take remaining parts, and inspire them with your own thinking, meditation, or simple existing understanding – maybe, dare I say, wisdom?</p>



<p>Analysis takes place hunched over, turned in, focused on the thing at hand. It excludes outside, it ignores promptings from intuition, and it creates a morbid morgue of stock-parts of understanding.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t reach, you mantle like a goshawk, until you see for yourself what makes up this thing.</p>



<p>News about the pandemic is broken. It breaks down. When it&#8217;s actually working, it&#8217;s producing data, facts, figures, numbers, and relationships between data.</p>



<p>But, when you try to make sense of it, you imbue the analysis with your breath of creativity. Just by learning something new, you do the opposite of analysis (breaking down). You build up, you create, you begin the process of synthesis. Putting together is creation.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why taking a photo, painting a picture, baking sourdough bread, successfully changing a nappy, and playing the violin, talking to a friend in a way that builds them up. Synthesis is creation, it&#8217;s edification, and it&#8217;s ours to use.</p>



<p>Also, creation is what&#8217;s attacked by stress, fear, and species-wide empathetic pain (that drain we feel because we&#8217;re all human, and we&#8217;re (uniquely to our lifetimes) all suffering.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been shit at this.</p>



<p>I haunch for hours, pulling apart this coronavirus until I know what an enveloped RNA-sequenced bastard of a disease is with no virology experience.</p>



<p>I extend this psychic demolition to my own life: how secure is my job now – and in 6 months? Can we evict our bad tenant without making the situation worse? Can we move house if we need to?</p>



<p>Can I start _any_ of the exciting, live/career-changing project I&#8217;ve just planned? Can I live a good life that helps my kid, my wife, and my community?</p>



<p>What this looks like in practice is that I take my camera out – a synthesis machine. And, I frame up some compositions, and can&#8217;t see a thing worth making. I write words down into a CMS, and I can&#8217;t say more than knee-jerk boilerplate words. I can&#8217;t play the drums, carve spoons, or draw.</p>



<p>And if you see the timestamp, I can&#8217;t sleep either.</p>



<p>But you know what?</p>



<p>I do want to understand, and will pursue the destruction of analysis when I need to.</p>



<p>But I&#8217;ll also continue to pick up my camera. I&#8217;ll still try to reach in preference to hunching. I&#8217;ll call you, and talk about art, writing, craft, and love – the edification of making. Because, that&#8217;s my life&#8217;s purpose.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unfocused, it&#8217;s badly disciplined, and I&#8217;ve got context-lenses that make it hard.</p>



<p>But, I will do anyway.</p>



<p>[Analysis]: <a href="https://www.oed.com/oed2/00007905?fbclid=IwAR2iEZbrLfHnZx--KAgTpkzrjv2FIEwbK4c_UyLsI8Y5R76ZVxHDaUN2MuU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.oed.com/oed2/00007905</a></p>



<p>[Synthesis]: {&#8220;In the philosophy of Kant, the action of the understanding in combining and unifying the isolated data of sensation into a cognizable whole.&#8221;}: <a href="https://www-oed-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/view/Entry/196574?redirectedFrom=synthesis&amp;fbclid=IwAR31Eh1P6HcF0oaIzIQUjhBuFTECYntqtWis5AWKYHmvHeH4Yne4Yu26uQw#eid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www-oed-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/…/Ent…/196574…</a></p>



<h2>Here are some of my defiant efforts at picking up the synthesis box.</h2>

<p>Thoughts follow thoughts, and patterns put a spin on them so they tend to go off in familiar directions.</p>



<p>Right now, where I&#8217;m at, I&#8217;m finding it incredibly easy to think about what could have been.</p>



<p>It starts quite practically: asking my imagination machine to show me what would have happened if, say, the US closed schools across the nation on 14th March. Imagine the much better state we&#8217;d be in now?</p>



<p>This gets transferred on to more supposition: what&#8217;d happen if they kept at finding better vaccines for Sars or Mers, that&#8217;d be basically ready to go jab everyone?</p>



<p>Then, for me, it goes to more biographical editing, as if life itself could be rewritten for clarity, emotional connection, or believably.</p>



<p>What would have happened if I&#8217;d studied a bit harder and got a first at uni? What if I&#8217;d studied something I _now_ know I should have studied? Would I finally be less shamed by my professional peers?</p>



<p>What would have happened if I hadn&#8217;t gone on those weird (now, kind of cultish in retrospect) summer camps, which lead to a gap-year that turned me into a British subject of Her Majesty (through a series of implausible events).</p>



<p>Now, a large part of my psyche lives for this kind of thing. It&#8217;s creative. It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s got an infinite supply of endlessly malleable source material from which to spin out stories. And, my imagination needs this – it&#8217;s my demon, my engine, my fuel. It&#8217;s the reason I can never answer the question: &#8220;Are you present?&#8221;</p>



<p>Mindfulness has been an interesting exercise, and it absolutely makes me feel better. But the &#8220;just being here now&#8221; isn&#8217;t me. It should probably be more me than it is now, but it&#8217;s not my default setting.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m back at the Ponderosa Lodge Ranch in Colorado&#8217;s Sangre de Christo mountains. It&#8217;s 1999 and I&#8217;m a 14-year-old, teaching teaching puppets to 19-year-olds. I&#8217;m wondering what it&#8217;d have been like if I&#8217;d just stayed there – become a decorative hermit of the culty pentacostals who I very much loved – every single one of them – but thought they were quite bloody mad. What if I were a bit better at social skills, and – to be absolutely frank – a lot better at not being such a weird kid?</p>



<p>And that string of thoughts, like bad jumpcuts in cheap video is the problem.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s vanity, naturally. All this thinking (and typing) about what could have been, is a kind of comfortable melancholy. It&#8217;s a cocktail of numbing agents, creativity, and analysis and heartache. But sometimes, it&#8217;s adulterated with any readibly available, fatal poisons: regret, judgement, entitlement, or flagellation.</p>



<p>Funny though how lockdown, big fear, and more uncertainty than I&#8217;ve ever faced push those thought-trains right through my soul – barely under my control.</p>



<p>But, you now what?</p>



<p>I grew up in a trailer park in the Colorado desert, and i told the Queen of England I&#8217;d faithfully serve her as her subject. I&#8217;ve had beers with the inventors of the internet, and shared supper with half of the Communards. I&#8217;ve had fat-tailed sheep kebab in the Tien Shan mountains and supped fermented mares&#8217; milk amongst ancient mountains. I&#8217;ve prayed and lit candles in vast cathedrals of medieval stone and let a bishop smack my face with a branch of rosemary (don&#8217;t ask) in one of the oldest churches in England.</p>



<p>Quarantine introspection. It&#8217;ll kill you slowly, if you let it.</p>



<p>But it might remind you of what kind of interesting, creative, loving, dependable, incomparable, kind, and funny person you are. Just don&#8217;t drink too deeply of the draught, and don&#8217;t let your demon spike it with toxic soul-gifts of regret, dispair, judgement, or self-harm.</p>



<p>You know why? It&#8217;s because in a few weeks, we need you strong, imaginative, and just-bored-enough self to make this broken world whole again.</p>



<p>Pax vobiscum; Illegitimi non carborundum.</p>
